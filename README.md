# unbox
Log your rekordbox tracks to a txt file as they're played. Inspired by PRACT OBS.

Download one of the below zip files. 

Here's the mac version: [Mac Download](https://github.com/erikrichardlarson/unbox/releases/download/1/unbox_mac.zip) and here's the windows version: [Windows Download](https://github.com/erikrichardlarson/unbox/releases/download/1/unbox_windows.zip)

Open the zip file you downloaded above, and open the app. Here's what you'll see:

**Please back up your library before using this as corruption could occur, we're not responsible for any issues, or corruption that this software may cause to your library.**

When the app is open, it will log your recent rekordbox history to a txt file that can be used in OBS. This file updates in real-time. 

Currently this only works on rekordbox 6, I'm looking into version 5 and how to support.
