# unbox
Log your rekordbox tracks to a txt file or HTML page as they're played. Inspired by PRACT OBS and ASOT.

Browser sources are now available for Mac. You can add either of these browser sources to OBS and you'll see your rekordbox tracks in the formats below:

http://localhost:8080/play_history.html
http://localhost:8080/now_playing.html

Here's the mac version: [Mac Download](https://github.com/erikrichardlarson/unbox/releases/download/3.0/unbox.zip) and here's the windows version: [Windows Download](https://github.com/erikrichardlarson/unbox/releases/download/2.0/unbox_windows.zip)

Open the zip file you downloaded above, and open the app. On Windows you'll want to click the unbox.exe file. 

**Please back up your library before using this as corruption could occur, we're not responsible for any issues, or corruption that this software may cause to your library.**

When the app is open, it will log your recent rekordbox history to a txt file that can be used in OBS. This file updates in real-time. 

Currently this only works on rekordbox 6, I'm looking into version 5 and how to support.
