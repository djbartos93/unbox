**Please back up your library before using this as corruption could occur, we're not responisble for any issues, or corruption that this software may cause to your library.**

When the app is open, it will log your recent rekordbox history to a txt file that can be used in OBS. This file updates in real-time. 

Currently this only works on Mac, but a Windows version is coming out very soon.
